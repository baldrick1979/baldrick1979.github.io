      <p class="text-white">Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group consisted of vocalist Robert Plant, guitarist 
                           Jimmy Page, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. With a heavy, guitar-driven sound, they are cited 
                           as one of the progenitors of hard rock and heavy metal, although their style drew from a variety of influences, including blues 
                           and folk music. Led Zeppelin have been credited as significantly impacting the nature of the music industry, particularly in the 
                           development of album-oriented rock (AOR) and stadium rock.</p>

                    on 31 March in the United Kingdom by Atlantic Records. The album was recorded in September and October 1968 at Olympic Studios 
                    in London, shortly after the band's formation. It contains a mix of original material worked out in the first rehearsals, and 
                    remakes and rearrangements of contemporary blues and folk songs.  They were produced by Page, who as a musician was joined by 
                    band members Robert Plant (lead vocals, harmonica), John Paul Jones (bass, keyboards), and John Bonham (drums).</p>

                locations in both the United Kingdom and North America from January to August 1969. The album exhibited the band's evolving musical 
                style of blues-derived material and their guitar riff-based sound. It has been described as the band's heaviest album. One single,
                 "Whole Lotta Love", was released outside of the UK (the band would release no UK singles during their career), and peaked as a 
                 top-ten single in over a dozen markets around the world.</p>

               <p class="text-white">Led Zeppelin III is the third studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, released on 5 October 1970. It was recorded in three 
                locations. Much of the work was done at Headley Grange, a country house, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Additional sessions 
                were held in more traditional recording studios, such as Island Studios and Olympic Studios in London. As with the prior album, 
                the band eschewed the use of guest musicians, with all music performed by band members Robert Plant (vocals), Jimmy Page (guitars), 
                John Paul Jones (bass, keyboards), and John Bonham (drums). The range of instruments played by the band was greatly enhanced on this album,
                 with Jones especially emerging as a talented multi-instrumentalist, playing a wide range of keyboard and stringed instruments, including 
                 various synthesizers, mandolin and double bass, in addition to his usual bass guitar.</p>

      <p class="text-white">James Marshall "Jimi" Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix; November 27, 1942 – September 18, 1970) was an American musician, singer, and songwriter.
                           Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular 
                           music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as "arguably the greatest instrumentalist 
                           in the history of rock music".</p>

                     approach to songwriting and electric guitar playing which soon established a new direction in psychedelic
                        and hard rock music.</p>

                successful debut, Are You Experienced. In the United States, Reprise Records delayed the release until the following 
                month. The album reached the top ten in the album charts in both countries.</p>

                produced by Hendrix. By mid-November, it had charted at number one in the US, where it spent two weeks at the top spot.
                 Electric Ladyland was the Experience's most commercially successful release and their only number one album. 
                 It peaked at number six in the UK, where it spent 12 weeks on the chart.</p>

      <p class="text-white">Cream were a British rock band formed in London in 1966. The group consisted of bassist Jack Bruce, guitarist Eric Clapton, and drummer Ginger Baker. Bruce was the primary 
                            songwriter and vocalist, although Clapton and Baker also sang and contributed songs. Formed from members of previously successful bands, they are widely regarded as the world's 
                            first supergroup. Cream were highly regarded for the instrumental proficiency of each of their members.</p>
