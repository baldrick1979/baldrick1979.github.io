      <p class="text-white">The Kinks were an English rock band formed in Muswell Hill, north London, in 1963 by brothers Ray and Dave Davies. 
                            They are regarded as one of the most influential rock bands of the 1960s. The band emerged during the height of 
                            British rhythm and blues and Merseybeat, and were briefly part of the British Invasion of the United States until their 
                            touring ban in 1965. They gained a reputation for reflecting English culture and lifestyle, fuelled by Ray Davies' wittily 
                            observational writing style</p>

                    It was released with three tracks omitted as You Really Got Me in the United States. The album was re-released in 
                    1998 in the UK on Castle Records with twelve bonus tracks. This reissue was itself reissued in 2004 on the Sanctuary 
                    label. Rock critic Mike Saunders of Rolling Stone had a more positive opinion of the Kinks' debut LP, described the 
                    album as one of their "successful rock and roll albums"</p>

                feature an identical tracklist to its UK counterpart. It is a transitional work, with elements of both the earlier Kinks' 
                styles (heavily blues-influenced songs such as "Milk Cow Blues" and variations on the band's hits from 1964–1965 such as 
                "Till the End of the Day") and early indications of the future direction of Ray Davies' songwriting styles 
                ("The World Keeps Going Round" and "I'm On an Island").</p>

                The album marked a shift from the hard-driving style of beat music that had catapulted the group to international acclaim in 1964. 
                It is their first album consisting entirely of Ray Davies compositions, and has also been regarded by critics as rock’s first concept
                 album. The album was included in Robert Christgau’s "Basic Record Library" of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in Christgau's 
                 Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). The album was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.</p>

      <p class="text-white">Small Faces were an English rock band from London, founded in 1965. The group originally consisted of Steve Marriott, Ronnie Lane, Kenney Jones and Jimmy Winston, 
                           with Ian McLagan replacing Winston as the band's keyboardist in 1966. The band was one of the most acclaimed and influential mod groups of the 1960s, recording hit 
                           songs such as "Itchycoo Park", "Lazy Sunday", "All or Nothing", and "Tin Soldier", as well as their concept album Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake. They later evolved into 
                           one of the UK's most successful psychedelic bands until 1969.</p>

                     The album was recorded at IBC Studios, Portland Place, London between June 1965 and February 1966. Glyn Johns was the studio

                 album Playmates in 1977). The album title and distinctive packaging design was a parody of Ogden's Nut-brown Flake, a brand of tinned loose 
                 tobacco that was produced in Liverpool from 1899 onwards by Thomas Ogden</p>

      <p class="text-white">The Zombies are an English rock band formed in the early 1960s in St Albans and led by keyboardist and vocalist Rod Argent and 
                            vocalist Colin Blunstone. The group had a British and American hit in 1964 with "She's Not There". In the US, two further singles—
                            "Tell Her No" in 1965 and "Time of the Season" in 1968—were also successful. Their 1968 album Odessey and Oracle is ranked number 
                             100 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The Zombies were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019</p>

                    released in April 1965 by Decca Records. In his retrospective review of the release, critic Mark Deming for 
                     AllMusic wrote "Given the wealth of fine original tunes that the Zombies released on various non-LP singles 
                     and EPs during this period, it's a shame that so much of Begin Here was given over to covers; it's still a 
                     fine album and certainly better than what most of their peers had to offer in 1965, but what could have been 
                     an achievement on a par with the Kinks' Face to Face or the Beatles' Rubber Soul ended up being something 
                     quite good instead of an unqualified triumph.</p>

               <p class="text-white">Odessey and Oracle is the second studio album by English rock band the Zombies. It was 
                originally released in the UK in April 1968 by CBS Records. The album was recorded between June and August 1967. 
                The sessions took place at Abbey Road Studios and Olympic Studios in London. It was received indifferently on 
                release. A single from the album, "Time of the Season", became a surprise hit in the United States in early 1969.       
               The album gradually achieved fame and has since become one of the most acclaimed albums of the 1960s. It was ranked 
               100th on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.</p>

               <p class="text-white">R.I.P., also known as R.I.P. - The Lost Album, is a studio album by English rock band the Zombies. 
                It was originally scheduled to be released in 1969, but was cancelled. It was finally released in Japan in October 2000 by Imperial Records.
                In 1968, Rod Argent and Chris White began working on material for a possible new band when they were approached by CBS to do another Zombies album. 
                Side A of the album is composed of new tracks that were cut with a lineup of Argent, Hugh Grundy, Jim Rodford (bass) and Rick Birkett (guitar). 
                Side B is composed of old out-takes and demos that were overdubbed and enhanced in sessions at Morgan Studios in London</p>
