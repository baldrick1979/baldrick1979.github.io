                     <p class="text-white">The Doors were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1965, with vocalist Jim Morrison, 
                      keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger, and drummer John Densmore. They were among the most controversial 
                      and influential rock acts of the 1960s; mostly due to Morrison's lyrics and voice, along with his erratic stage persona, 
                      and the group was widely regarded as an important part of the era's counterculture.

                              <p class="text-white">The Doors is the eponymous debut studio album of the American rock band the Doors. 
                                Recorded in 1966 at Sunset Sound Recorders, Hollywood, California, it was produced by Paul A. Rothchild and released on January 4, 1967. Since its release, 
                                the record has been often regarded as one of the greatest debut albums of all time, by both critics and publishers. It features the long version of the breakthrough 
                                single "Light My Fire" and the lengthy song "The End" with its Oedipal spoken word section.

                                Following their formation and later-dismissal from the owners of Whisky a Go Go, the Doors started recording their debut album under the maintenance of Elektra Records 
                                in August, 1966. The recording of The Doors established the band's large extensive number of musical influences, such as jazz, classical, blues, pop, R&B and rock music.
                                Its overall presentation has been viewed as an essential part of the psychedelic rock evolution, while it have also been acknowledged as a source of inspiration to other works. 
                                Paul McCartney of the Beatles, has claimed that following the album's release, he wanted his band to capitalize the Doors musical style as one of the "alter egos" of the group, 
                                for their upcoming album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
                                
                                The Doors and "Light My Fire" have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2015 the Library of Congress selected The Doors for inclusion in the National Recording 
                                Registry based on its cultural, artistic or historical significance.</p>

                          <p class="text-white"> Strange Days is the second studio album by the American rock band the Doors, released on September 25, 1967, by Elektra Records.
                            Upon release, the album reached number three on the US Billboard 200, and eventually earned RIAA platinum certification. It contains the Top 30 hit singles 
                            "People Are Strange" and "Love Me Two Times".</br>
                            Strange Days was recorded during tour breaks between May and August 1967 at Sunset Sound Recorders in Hollywood (the same studio as their first LP). In contrast
                             to the 1966 sessions, producer Paul A. Rothchild and engineer Bruce Botnick employed a cutting-edge 8-track recording machine. The protracted sessions allowed 
                             the band to experiment in the studio and further augment their otherworldly sound with unusual instrumentation and sonic manipulation. According to Botnick, 
                             this approach was inspired by the band obtaining an advance copy of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and "absolutely flipping out" at what they heard. 
                             Botnick said that, following the Beatles' example, the Doors were determined to pursue "new techniques of recording. No holds barred."</p>

                          <p class="text-white"> L.A. Woman is the sixth studio album by the American rock band the Doors, released on April 19, 1971, by Elektra Records. It is the last to feature lead singer
                          Jim Morrison during his lifetime due to his death three months after the album's release, though he would posthumously appear on the 1978 album An American Prayer. 
                          Even more so than its predecessors, the album is heavily influenced by blues. It was recorded without record producer Paul A. Rothchild after he fell out with the 
                          group over the perceived lack of quality of their studio performances. Subsequently, the band co-produced the album with longtime sound engineer Bruce Botnick. 
                          "Love Her Madly" was released as a single in March 1971, preceding the album's release, and reached the Top 20 in the Billboard Hot 100. Upon release, the album 
                          peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200[2] and reached number 28 on the UK Albums Charts.[3] The track "Riders on the Storm" also achieved chart success. Critics 
                          Richie Unterberger and David Quantick have both called L.A. Woman one of the Doors' best albums, citing Morrison's vocal performance, and the band's stripped-down 
                          return to their blues rock roots.</p>
